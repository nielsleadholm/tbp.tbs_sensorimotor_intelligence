# tbp.tbs_sensorimotor_intelligence

This repository contains code to replicate experiments from our paper, "Thousand Brains Systems: Sensorimotor Intelligence for Rapid, Robust Learning and Inference".

## Installation & Experiments

Experiments make use of either the Monty framework, or Pytorch in the case of deep learning models. These can be found under their respective directories `monty` and `pytorch`.

For instructions on how to run experiments, please refer to the respective README files in the `monty` and `pytorch` directories.

Information on licensing can also be found in the respective directories.
